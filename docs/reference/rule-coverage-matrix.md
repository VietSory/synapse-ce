# Rule catalog coverage matrix

This matrix is generated from the shipped first-party rule catalog. The drift test fails whenever the catalog and this snapshot diverge.

OWASP coverage is required for security-quality rules. An empty OWASP list on a non-security rule means not applicable. Direct CWE mappings follow OWASP Top 10:2021's published mapped-CWE lists where available; CWEs outside those lists use explicit Synapse-reviewed Top 10 classifications and are not presented as OWASP-published CWE crosswalks.

Catalogued rules: **3377**. Security-quality rules with an OWASP mapping: **1226/1226**.
