// Package reachproof is the coordinator that turns a deterministic reachability result into a CONFIRMED
// reachability Judgment, reusing the existing audited propose→verify gate rather than any new
// confirmed-state path. It runs the reachability analysis for an engagement's target, and for each finding
// mints a ReachabilityClaim at the analyzer's tier (Go call-graph → Tier-2, Python source-import → Tier-1)
// that supersedes a weaker prior judgment (a stronger prior stands — a Tier-1 import proof never downgrades
// a Tier-2 call-path proof).
//
// SAFETY (security-reviewed):
// Two RESERVED, mutually-distinct, non-agent/non-human identities: proposer = the scan, verifier
// = the engine. The domain self-confirm guard is satisfied because they differ, and it stays meaningful
// for the agent path (no agent is involved; this coordinator is not agent-reachable).
// The proof IS the evidence: the verdict carries the call path + a fixed deterministic score.
// No coverage (build failed) mints NOTHING – the weaker prior judgment stands, never a false
// "not reachable". Only a SUCCESSFUL build yields reachable / not-reachable judgments.
// Supersession is append-only: a NEW judgment row + an audit entry naming BOTH sides; the prior
// judgment is never mutated or deleted.
