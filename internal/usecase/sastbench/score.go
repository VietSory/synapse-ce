// Package sastbench scores the owned SAST/taint engine against a standard external benchmark (OWASP
// BenchmarkJava) and reduces the result to a per-category precision/recall scorecard with a regression
// ratchet. It is a pure reducer: the engine's detections and the benchmark's answer key are passed in, so
// this package holds no infrastructure and is deterministic. The scorecard is scoped to the CWE classes the
// engine MODELS (command injection, SQL injection, path traversal, LDAP injection, XPath injection, and
// reflected XSS); categories it does not model are reported as "not covered" rather than scored, so the
// numbers never misrepresent the engine on a vulnerability class it does not claim.
//
// The precision figure is PROPOSE-STAGE: the taint engine is a propose-stage proposer that deliberately
// models no sanitizers, so it flags the benchmark's sanitized-safe variants (which a downstream verify /
// triage stage filters). Recall is therefore the meaningful regression signal, and the ratchet gates on it.

// that subset — stored/DOM XSS are not modeled and drag the OWASP xss recall down honestly rather than being
// hidden. Their recall floors stay uncommitted in owasp-benchmark-floors.json until a gated OWASP run
// calibrates them, so they are measured and reported but not yet recall-gated (a new category starts ungated
