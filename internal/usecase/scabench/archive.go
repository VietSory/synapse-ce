// ArchivedPin records that a catalog pin's exact bytes were preserved, not merely digested.
//
// ArtifactPin proves two captures used the same bytes and says where those bytes came from. It
// cannot prove the bytes are still obtainable. Vendors republish these feeds in place: Red Hat
// regenerates a CSAF VEX document under the same CVE filename, and the SUSE OVAL, Debian OVAL, and
// OSV snapshots change size between fetches of the same advertised build. Once a document is
// regenerated the originally pinned bytes are gone from the origin, so a later capture on fresh
// infrastructure cannot reproduce the pinned digest and legitimately fails every floor.
//
// An archive entry closes that gap by binding the pin reference to bytes held in content-addressed
// storage under the pin's own digest. Recapture then verifies against retained evidence instead of
// against whatever the vendor serves today.
