// Assemble builds a taint.FlowGraph from a call graph + the catalog, realizing a coarse
// control-flow-as-data-flow over-approximation: a function that CALLS a catalog source/sink/sanitizer takes
// on that role, and the call edges become Flows. FlowGraph.Vulnerabilities() then reports a forward call
// path from a source-using function to a sink-using function that crosses no sanitizer-using function – and
// the classic same-function shape (`db.Query(r.FormValue(...))`) where one function is both source- and
// sink-using surfaces as the length-1 path Vulnerabilities() already models.
//
// The second return is the sink-class index: a FlowGraph sink-node ("importPath.Symbol" of the *using*
// function) → the distinct catalog Sinks it calls (CWE + rule, sorted by symbol), so the judgment
// coordinator can tag each reported path with its injection class – and a function that reaches two
// sink classes yields a claim per class rather than silently dropping one. The index is keyed by the
// using-function and lists every sink class that function calls regardless of sanitizer pruning, so the
// consumer must JOIN it against the paths Vulnerabilities() actually reports (sinkClass[path.Sink]) rather
// than treat every listed class as source-reachable.
//
// Coarseness (gated + triaged, NOT presented as precise): function granularity ⇒
// a false POSITIVE when the tainted value does not actually reach the sink's argument; and
// false NEGATIVES on shapes a call graph alone can't separate at value level: the sibling-call shape (a
// function gets tainted data from one callee and hands it to another, with no forward edge between the
// two using-functions); a function that sanitizes one value but sinks another (the sanitizer role walls
// the whole node); a source-using function that ALSO calls a sanitizer (walled at the source – the
// mirror of the previous case); and class-blindness – a sanitizer node walls EVERY injection class
// through it, not only the class it neutralizes.
//
// Precise SSA def-use closes these and is the deferred follow-up; this MVP is the recall floor that a
// distinct human/LLM verifier gates before promotion. Because the wall is class-blind, the sanitizer set is
// kept to PURPOSE-BUILT neutralizers (escapers / containment checks) and deliberately omits incidental
// general utilities (e.g. strconv.Atoi) that, walling every flow through their caller, would suppress
// unrelated real injections.
