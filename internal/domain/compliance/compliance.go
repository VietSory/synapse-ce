// Package compliance maps a finding's CWE to the regulatory/standard controls it bears on (compliance
// mapping). It is the CURATED TABLE – deterministic, human-curated reference data sourced from each
// framework's PUBLISHED CWE/category guidance, NEVER inferred at runtime (an AI-assisted mapping is a later,
// separately-gated layer, per the phase plan's "curated table first"). So a compliance tag is auditable: it
// is a lookup, not a model output, and the report path stays LLM-free.
//
// Coverage: the CWEs Synapse actually emits today (the pattern-SAST rules – CWE-327/295/798) plus the common
// injection/SSRF/deserialization classes (the taint packs + advisory findings). An UNMAPPED CWE returns no
// controls – fail-open-to-nothing (never a fabricated mapping). Frameworks:
// OWASP Top 10 2021: the authoritative per-CWE category (each CWE is listed under exactly one category).
// PCI DSS 4.0 req 6.2.4: secure-coding for the attack classes 6.2.4 explicitly enumerates (injection,
// XSS, crypto, access control, auth) – NOT claimed for classes it doesn't name.
// ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.8.28: "Secure coding" – applies to every code-weakness CWE here.
